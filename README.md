This is an express web server that serves my `https://github.com/Z4rkal/San-Diego-Top-Spots` project.

A working example of what the project looks like while it's running is located at: `https://node101-express-server.zarkal.now.sh/`. Now is a cloud based deployment platform developed by `https://zeit.co/about`.

In order to build this project you will need NodeJS and Node Package Manager (npm), so make sure you have those installed.

You can clone it to your system with `git clone git@github.com:Z4rkal/Top-Spots-Express-Server.git`
and then use `npm install` to download the dependencies.

After everything is setup, you can use `npm start` to start the server!
The server will listen on port 3000 and will log to the terminal you use to launch it.
