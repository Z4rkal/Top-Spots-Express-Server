This is an express web server that serves my `https://github.com/Z4rkal/San-Diego-Top-Spots` project.

The Now lambda is located at : ` `

In order to build this project you will need node.js and node package manager, so make sure you have those installed.

You can clone it to your system with `git clone git@github.com:Z4rkal/Top-Spots-Express-Server.git`
and then use `npm install` to download the dependencies.

After everything is setup, you can use `npm start` to start the server!
The server will listen on port 3000 and will log to the terminal you use to launch it.
